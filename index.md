## Who am I?
### Programmer Life
I'm an 3rd year Math-CS undergrad at UCSD. My programming experience comprises of C, C++, and Java. I'm somewhat familiar with Linux and its variations, along with using its terminal. I have worked with others on coding projects for classes before, but my exposure is still quite limited. Fortunately, along the way I've picked up some useful knowledge on debuggers and Linux terminal, with its built-in editor _vim_.

### Personal Life
Speaking of DDR, I am an avid gamer and *weeb*. I tend to stick towards RPGs, FPSs, and air-sim games. Some of my favorites include: 
-[_Kingdom Hearts_](https://www.kingdomhearts.com/home/us/)
-[_Final Fantasy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy)
-[_Ace Combat_](https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/Ace_Combat)
-[_Call of Duty_](https://www.callofduty.com/home)
-[_Skyrim_](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim)

As for my anime tendencies, I watch random stuff from stuff trending all over like Attack on Titan and lesser known works like Kino's Journey. My choices pretty much stem from animation style, music, or if I simply like the universe. If it has mechs, planes, or cars, I'm more inclined to give the first episode a try.

On the off chance that you're someone who's into Happy Hardcore music, feel free to contact me and share your favs! I still haven't met anyone who listens to the genre as much as I do...

In the wise words of Darwin:
> Why not, you should!
> Listen to the music and dance right through the night!

I've tried my hand at creating EDM, but it's still quite an amateurish track. I do hope to return to it someday when I can understand the intricacies of music theory better.
