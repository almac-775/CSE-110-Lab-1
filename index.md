## Who am I?
I'm an 3rd year Math-CS undergrad at UCSD. My programming experience comprises of C, C++, and Java. I'm somewhat familiar with Linux and its variations, along with using its terminal. Here's some navigational tips for vim:
```
H left
J down
K up
L right
```
I dare you to play Dance Dance Revolution with that!


Speaking of DDR, I am an avid gamer and *weeb*. I tend to stick towards RPGs, FPSs, and air-sim games. Some of my favorites include: 
-[_Kingdom Hearts_](https://www.kingdomhearts.com/home/us/)
-[_Final Fantasy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy)
-[_Ace Combat_](https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/Ace_Combat)
-[_Call of Duty_](https://www.callofduty.com/home)
-[_Skyrim_](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim)

For anime, I watch random stuff from stuff trending all over like Attack on Titan and lesser known works like Kino's Journey. My choices pretty much stem from animation style, music, or if I simply like the universe. If it has mechs, planes, or cars, I'm more inclined to give the first episode a try.
